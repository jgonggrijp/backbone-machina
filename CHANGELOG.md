# Changelog of backbone-machina

Newest version on top.


## 1.0.0 â€” 2018-09-03

Initial release. Included machina.Fsm and Backbone.Events interfaces as well as enter:state and exit:state events. Lacked support for the `eventListeners` option, which made it impossible to create hierarchical FSMs.
